Given name of a person, the task is to welcome the person by printing the name with "Welcome". If name is "John", you should print "Welcome John".

Example 1:

Input:
name = John
Output:
Welcome John
Example 2:

Welcome Python
Your Task:
This is a function problem. You need to complete the function welcomeAboard() and print the required string.

Constraints:

#CODE:

def welcomeAboard(name):
    print("Welcome", name)

# Call the function with the name 'John'
welcomeAboard("John")
